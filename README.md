# uPort Hackathon Projects
A list of community hackathon projects and other experiments.

## How It Works
Have you recently attended a hackathon and created a new project using uPort's self-sovereign identity platform? Awesome! 

uPort will even pay you (DAI stable tokens) to share your work with other developers. Make a pull request with the project details, write an article and/or record a video of the projec. Share the with the world how you're using self-sovereign identity systems in a decentralized application.

uPort will send you DAI stable tokens upon approval of the pull request using Gitcoin's Tip Tool https://gitcoin.co/tip

#### EthTollway
Our project provides a straightforward process for clients to send ERC20 tokens to exchanges to be traded without requiring ether to be present in the clients wallets. This web interface functions using uPort, the 0x orderbook, a small store of ether to fulfill the gas payments needed to forward client tokens. Clients specify parameters of the token they want to send, and the address they are trying to send to. ETH Tollway makes full use of the reputation and attestation solutions uPort provides in order to trust the users with deposited ether.
