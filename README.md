# uPort Community Projects
A list of uPort community projects.

## How It Works
Have you recently attended a hackathon or actively developing a decentralized application useing uPort's self-sovereign identity platform? Awesome! We would love to learn about it. And also support the project by funding project bounties, providing 1-on-1 support and understanding how we can create a better developer experience.

uPort will even pay you (DAI stable tokens) to share your decentralized application with other developers.

It's simple. Make a pull request with the project details, so the rest of the world can see what you're building and well send you 5 DAI in 24 hours or less. Plus, write an article or record a video of the project and we'll payout an additional 15 DAI.

uPort will send you DAI stable tokens upon approval of the pull request using Gitcoin's Tip Tool https://gitcoin.co/tip

## Know 2018 - One World Identity


### Digiport
The DigiPort IOS Application utilizes uPort’s decentralized identity platform and Digi.me centralized account import/export features to save potential KYC (know your customer) information using uPort’s attestations system.

Using simple hashing techniques the DigiPort IOS application can easily verify identity information (name, email, address, etc…) across multiple centralized services. Once the data is confirmed (exact matches) across multiple applications that information is saved as an attestation within the uPort application.

### Feel Good
A blood donation system which provides end to end traceability through web and mobile. A donation center authorized by the government (Like Red Cross, Denver) takes donors information and signs it using uPort (calling a smart contract) which logs the information and stores it using events.

Accolades: FeelGood project was a winner of the Ethdenver hackathon project.

### EthTollway
Our project provides a straightforward process for clients to send ERC20 tokens to exchanges to be traded without requiring ether to be present in the clients wallets. This web interface functions using uPort, the 0x orderbook, a small store of ether to fulfill the gas payments needed to forward client tokens. Clients specify parameters of the token they want to send, and the address they are trying to send to. ETH Tollway makes full use of the reputation and attestation solutions uPort provides in order to trust the users with deposited ether.
